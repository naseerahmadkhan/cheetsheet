React UI Library
let const var => react do not track variables
State = > status, situation
all the updates should go via states
useState is a hook that give capability to change state in functional comp

const [count, setcount] = useState(initialVal)

count = this a read only variable. we can not directly change it. if you do no ui update

setCount =  is function , that updates read only value


useState() returns array
we use destructuring
0 index var
1 index fun

when we want to update ui on change of var

 = useState(()=>{
	return getInitialVal();
});

this will run only one



setCount(count + 1);
react do not immediate update val. it schedules in the scheduler
setCount(count+1)
setCount(count+1)
setCount(count+1)

now run the scheduler 

react batches the update

******************

setCount((previousVal)=>{ return previousVal  + 1 })
